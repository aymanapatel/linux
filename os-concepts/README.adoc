== Semaphore and Mutex


=== Semaphore

> Restrict the number of threads that can access a resource. Example, limit max 10 connections to access a file simultaneously. 

=== Mutex


> Only one thread to access a resource at once. Example, when a client is accessing a file, no one else should have access the same file at the same time.
