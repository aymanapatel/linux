== Java

=== Semaphore

```
// Semaphore can make sure only 4 people can access simultaneously.
static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(4);
```

Observe the above output carefully, you will see that there are maximum 4 people [B : got the permit!](C, B, F, D) to perform an operation at a time, the people A and E are waiting. As soon as one of them release the lock [D : releasing lock...](D and F), A and E will acquire it and resumes immediately.



=== Mutex

> Mutex is Semaphore (java class) with access of 1.

```
//Mutex is the Semaphore with an access count of 1.
static Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1);
```
As it can be seen, only one thread executes at a time here.[A : got the permit!] This is the role of a Mutex.
